# EPS-Modeling

Using PyBaMM to model HS2's battery pack. Currerently working on:
1) Creating an objective method for comparing PyBaMM predictions with real test data
2) Systematically tweaking parameter values to get a better model of our test data
3) Incorporating battery degradation mechanisms
4) Creating a more streamlined way to turn requirements into a subsystem schedule
5) Simulating longer experiments (weeks/months in orbit)
